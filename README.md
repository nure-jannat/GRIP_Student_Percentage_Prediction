# GRIP_Task1
This is a task about predicting the student percentage based on study hours using Supervised Machine Learning. The dataset contains 25 rows and 2 columns which are study 'Hours' and 'Scores'. Here Scores is the target variable. For building ML model, I have done some data analysis, check for outliers, visualiza the dataset using some graph. There is a strong positive corelation between Hours and Scores. I used 70% of the data for traing and rest of the 30% for testing the model. For Evaluating the model, I used Mean Squared Error(MSE), Mean Absolute Error(MAE), R-Square value.
